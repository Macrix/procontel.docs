  <p>In terms of ProconTEL, a distributed application consists of two or more of physically and logically
    decoupled computer programs. The physical separation means that programs can be hosted by
    different system processes - even on different computers across the network. The logical
    separation means that programs being part of a distributed application are developed as
    independent code units - typically they have no references to each other. There is also another,
    important assumption about programs being part of a distributed application: in the most of the
    possible use scenarios programs communicate with each other.</p>
